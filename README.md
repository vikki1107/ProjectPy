# ProjectPy

ProjectPy is one of my pet project in which I develop some basic to complex python programs. This includes
- **Academic work**: Programs developed during my academic career. These are based on the python_programs.docx document. So refer that document to understand what program-n.py mean and does.
- **All other work**: Programs developed casually
