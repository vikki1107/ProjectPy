# ProjectPy

ProjectPy is one of my pet project where I develop some basic to complex python programs. This includes
- **Academic Programs**
- **Non-academic Programs**

## Academic Programs
Programs developed during my academic career. These are based on the [README.md](https://github.com/vikki1107/ProjectPy/blob/main/academic/README.md) document. So refer that document to understand what program-n.py mean and does.

## Non-academic Programs
Programs developed just for fun.
- Check US immigration visa appointment dates in CANADA.
A small program, [visaAppointmentsCAN.py](https://github.com/vikki1107/ProjectPy/blob/main/visaAppointmentsCAN.py) which uses selenium and applescript to extract the available visa appointments from Canada and sends an iMessage. The program uses chromedriver. So download the appropriate chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org
- One version of Caesar Cipher is present in my academic directory. However this [Caesar's Cipher](https://github.com/vikki1107/ProjectPy/blob/main/caesarCipher.py) another version which  uses dictionaries.
